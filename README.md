# Using "chatgpt-telegrambot". Why did I do it.
We all know that when using Google Translate to translate English sentences, they are often translated incorrectly. 
Fortunately, "Text-Davinci-003" came to our aid. 
ChatGPT's interface has become difficult to use due to the millions of users, 
I wanted to solve this problem with the help of the ChatGPT API and use Telegram as the interface.

##
Planned upgrades:
- Run on server with flask
- Convert to asynchronous programming with asyncio
- Add more Text-Davinci-003 features
